Best
Delivered on time and the product was as per specs. No cheating.
Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).
Pros:
Nice and small phone. Good for showing off.
Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.
It‚Äôs a powerful and ultra smooth Device and no doubt on that. As far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease.
Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.
Anything and everything. Been a iPhone user earlier also. Was skeptical about purchasing a relatively expensive product online but Amazon service turned out to be flawless..
Handy and easy to use with single hand. Battry life is average. Camera is perfect
"You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you‚Äôre coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get."
due to this phoneüòá My dream came true in this yearüòú even without sell kidneys ü§£ü§£ü§£. thanks Amazon and ICICI EMI üôèüôèüôè
Good
It‚Äôs only good for who have below iphone 11 .. till iphone 11 no need to upgrade on this. I had iphone 11 and I am regretting to update on 13 because not so much change we got here
"This is my first iphone and hence i was very much skeptical of buying it initially, however seeing then reviews snd the specifications i bought this phone.."
Posting this review after a week of heavy usage. Credit to apple for making a powerful device with such an extraordinary build and Smooth running OS with tons of great features. Listing down all the pros and cons of iphone 13 mini
"Though to start I have been an anti apple person, due to prices at which apple provides its products with lesser features than the android, I am liking the phone in my hand."
Loved this
"This is the best for me at least, I have always wanted compact phones which can do everything like today‚Äôs big and flagship phones, so initially I was going for 12 mini but then I heard reviews of that about how bad is the battery life, so I waited for this phone. Now I am happy to tell you that this iPhone 13 mini comes with much better battery life then 12 mini and considering its compact size. Everyday I notice and love how satisfying it is to use this phone with one hand like we used to long ago. Thank you Apple."
"So this review is after using the phone for a week. To begin with after having used different android phones which all basically slow down , I switched back to apple with this"
"It is not very great but the look and feel is premium. It is for sure a camera phone, it is not for those who don't have fancy towards phones,if it is the frist time ur using an Iphone then the funtionality is complicated but if u really know how everything works in Ipone then u would not struggle handling it. Of Couse it is not the money but having it been apple its ok."
The phone is really good. I love it.
"Best compact phone in its category. Don‚Äôt expect a huge improvement in battery life, but gets the job done and lasts for an entire day. Worth the money if you‚Äôre looking for a compact, fast and reliable product from apple."
"Its a powerful phone. The camera is pretty good. Pictures are very clear, even in low light"
"I was using 7 128gb and upgraded to 13 mini. To me nothing really changed just the chip, 5g, RAM and camera that‚Äôs all."
Mesmerised by its power packed performance. Although battery life is only 1 day with average usage but that makes sense with compact size. Besides this refresh rate is another area which Apple needs to work on.
This fantastic smallest smart phone in market. It‚Äôs unbelievable. I am not sure if apple will launch mini series in upcoming launches or not. For small size phone lovers it‚Äôs worth to upgrade. Go for it.
Simply superb
"Apple always gives quality product. The best part of this mobile is, you can take photos in dark also. It takes clear picture in dark as well. I would suggest to go for it. Battery backup is good."
iPhone 13 mini is for people who love compact mobiles. Camera quality is superb as usual. The only drawback I could see is battery life which lasts only for 1 day if your a moderate user and it‚Äôs last only for half a day if you start watching movies. Leaving the battery performance issue iPhone 13 mini is a phone I would recommend to buy after using for 3 months
Little Expensive but Good Product
Ring tone not working. No sound at all
"For me, it‚Äôs a very practical phone. The one handed approach is something that I was looking for and this phone fits right in."
My observations after about a month‚Äôs use
"I like how easy it is now to stay on call for long, to quickly take the phone out for a photo. Tbh i do not consume content on youtube and i only use instagram once in a while and whatsapp for texting. So this phone just works for me perfectly. Otherwise i listen to music on it. Coming on to specs, it is ofcourse a champ. The battery lasts 24 hours easily in my case with 5 hours of screentime. Out of 16 hours of my day, thats the max i use my phone."
"Product & its delivery is good by Amazon, but never buy anything using Amazon pay later & if you have an account already, please close it. First is they never answer your call when calling customer care number and they never confirm they receiving our money when paid. Secondly they unnecessarily charge you interest even if you cancel the order giving all sort of answers."
Battery needs improvement‚Ä¶it‚Äôs difficult while travelling to maintain the charge‚Ä¶but fast charging helps a lot‚Ä¶
Loved the compactness of the phone. It feels so light in hand that I don‚Äôt need to do gymnastics everyday with my phone. Perfect fit for not so heavy users like me.
 Only dislike is Apple won‚Äôt provide adapter to charge.
I was planning to upgrade from 12 mini as I was facing battery issues. So this is the perfect size and battery is remarkably improved over 12 mini. Perfect phone for me. Green color is classy and gets people's attention.
Been an apple & iPhone user for years. Always missed the iPhone 5/6 days üòÇ
"This will be my first iphone experience I have been reviewed many years in purchasing the iPhone you can't compare with the Android and iPhone ios, the experience you will get from ios is completely different its worth buying I need small display with handy one so I choosed 13 mini ."
It is very nice product of course and nice packaging from Amazon also
 In a nutshell this phone is a beast üòé. It so much comfortable in hands and I don't have to do any finger gymnasticsü§≠
"No complaints in the camera, battery department. Device heats up when playing games. There are minor bugs, especially in the phone and settings app. I‚Äôve been unable to make/pickup calls on multiple occassions. And Apple, as is the standard, has not included the charging brick and the earphones to increase their profits."
 Updating my review completely after using 13 Mini for 6 months. The image quality has dropped down drastically even if made a pinch zoom on picture. I think the old iphone had a better camera quality than this mini. Battery is as shit as before not much improved. Display okay. Not worth for the price wish I would have bought an oneplus instead of this. But few features are great. If your planning to buy then go for 13 instead 13 mini I would say
Was using IPhone 7 because was quite perfect for one hand use and was not changing it as was too comfortable. iPhone 13 mini is the perfect for user like me. On time delivery and good offers
"Go for this beautiful piece without second thought if you want medium size phone. Battery is very power full if not playing games. Price is high but it‚Äôs apple product, so can‚Äôt compare with android phone price. Only issue is that need to pay extra for charger that‚Äôs something people don‚Äôt like. Camera quality is awesome."
"Expensive as usual. But good battery life. Lasts for 1.5 days for me with good usage. Handy due to smaller size. Amazing camera, nice performance. Overall a satisfactory purchase."
Review after using it for a week. Switched to Apple because of the ever growing size of android devices. Couldn‚Äôt make a better choice. Very compact and easy to use. Battery life is excellent. Lasts entire day with moderate to heavy usage similar to my last phone. Screen size is good enough for watching videos because of zero bezels. Display quality is awesome. It took no time to get used to after switching from Oneplus seven. Excellent camera as expected from Apple. It‚Äôs the best smartphone of 2021.
If screen size is not an issue this is the ideal smartphone. Battery life is really a surprise. Never topped it up in the same day. Camera as you know it‚Äôs excellent. And so so comfortable to use bcz of use.
Pros: Fits in the hand. Light weight at 140 gms for the power it packs.
It's very compact
"I switched from 7plus to 13 , and its new feeling allowing me to stick with iphone ever."
"Battery life is good, value of money is good,touch screen is good it is pocketable."
Phone is awesome and it‚Äôs feeling like premium phone but battery is not really that level. One full charge also does not even last for one day
A strong and handy device. Wish more devices with small / compact screens comes up. Apple has really made it worthy.
Hello Guys. I just sold my 13 mini after 1 week of use the main reason why I sold is screen size I cant watch movie also If I spend more than an hour my eyes are getting pain. Everything else it is 101% worthy you can buy blindly. Screen is too small for normal people.
Product looks good but adapter is not provided with phone that is very bad and have to spend another 2k
No value for money (30 to 35 k is okay here iam mentioning only mini not other models) and ther is no finger print option.
All parameters sre are good
 Awesome mini. Loving every bit of it. Balue for money. Light red weight. Ease of handling
everything except the price is great but the user experience worth it!
It waw product small wid many features.if you play game go for iPhone 13.battery life also gud.all time gud products ..
Best iphone. Small size but no compromise on performance. Just go for it !!!
Phone is pretty cool and handy my type easy one hand typing and security is great but I am a little bit upset for its heating problem after using it for a bit of time
"At first the phone my feel small, but within a few days, you will feel right at home! 5.4 inches was a standard screen size a few years ago with additional chunky chins and foreheads. So imagine a phone with that more than adequate screen size, but without at bezels and with flagship specs and best in class camera! That‚Äôs the iPhone 13 mini ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Display stopped as nd black face only
well it is an apple phone but for me mini for 80 k is too much nothing much new from it last model
"Nothing much to think about it. If you‚Äôre thinking to buy, don‚Äôt think just go a head."
"Writing this review after 3 months of usage..1st of all packaging was very bad from Amazon,they just packed phone box inside a Amazon‚Äôs plastic cover without any outer layer on it..i was surprised to see the packaging coz I have seen other products costed below 500 had superb packaging.."
Best phone ever i purchased good performance and great battery and and the screen size is also handy.
It‚Äôs really small and beautiful phone with updated specks
Battery life not so good.. it's needs to b improved.
Getting more than one day battery life in regular use.
Go for it if you like Apple Ecosystem. It was a much needed update for me coming from a 1st Gen Iphone SE. Used the first iphone for 4 years and I wanted to continue in the same ecosystem as I have habituated by the iOS interface.
"Amazing phone. Great Battery Life. Super fast. Small, Compact and Pretty"
Just what I want !!!!
"With high excitement I received this mini I m glad on the first impression, after months usage will post further"
Apple ever the great. Battery life pathetic
Worry about battery life?
good product original delivery
"About 128 GB starlight variant. Awesome phone. Super fast processor. Works smoothly. Excellent camera and sound quality. I am a youtuber and it's my main device to record, edit and upload."
It is hanging like anything. Even switching off is not working so restart not working. please help me out.
Very good phone with face mask unlock after updating beta version. No issue of battery life for moderate use.
App support
"There is no phone than iPhone. Especially impressed with battery, shortcuts, camera and overall built up"
Thanks
"I have changed from Iphone 6S to iphone 13 mini, so lots of changes, i like everything about it."
" Mini is the real deal, Most will say its not worth having a mini phone but for those who know , Know its awosome to have a compact device."
Loved it for security reasons
Best phone. With its compact size and easy to use. Go for it if size doesn't bother you much.
"I recommended don‚Äôt waste money to buy this phone , Camera is worst at night"
Nice
Cute and functionally awesome
Couldn't agree more how good this phone is. My dream smartphone. Full paisa wasool
It's a great purchase. The phone is super good.
"Mind blowing , Must buy"
Best phone to use

Fantastic product
Battery is really great and all new futures as needed
First time using ios. Having a seemless experience.
Good
Like but very less functions than android mobile phones apps are very costly. Google app are not working for iPhone
"I have received a product with manufacturing defect, the button is not pressable properly, it's stuck inside. and just within 6 days of usage I have identified it."
Best Mini series & excellent for photography
Everything as per description
Long battery life
Beautiful phone easy one hand operation love it !!

"Feather touch screen , Razor sharp camera and good battery life"
"Need to recharge on every 24hrs, Battery drains very fast while browse and video calls."
Battery life awesome
Damaged product received. Would never suggest anyone to buy online.
It is not so good compare to money I spend.
Touch Quality is Poor
Excellent
Go for it blindly..
As personal phone
 Good
Highly disappointed with the iPhone 13 mini and it is not worth even for 40k RS worst battery life (sot - 3.5hours)and the app performance is not good for 3rd party apps and selfie camera is like 5 mp of budget phones and has heating issues and a15 bionic chip is not that great as advertised
Amazon customer care rejected replacement. Contacted apple. they will provide replacement only if the product bought from apple official website. Asked to check with apple service centre. Amazon simply cheating. There is no 7 days replacement policy
"Biggest ever regret buying this phone. Hangs in between and many times you don‚Äôt see options in different apps due to small screen size. Even the buttons at bottom are not clickable in some apps. Don‚Äôt expect a good battery life, hardly full charge stays for a day even when the phone is idle. At this price, better go for other options. The camera quality is also not that good as expected."
Got defective iPhone 13 mini from Amazon and there is no replace option......i suggest don't buy iPhone from Amazon
Regarding battery life it's too less and system getting heat while using
Very bad product it doesn't give iphone plug people have to spend extra after spending so much
"Phone is getting heat up like a heater while charging. Its camera focus is very bad, not upto the mark as per this cost. Too heavy. Overal worse experience with iPhone. Not at all value for money."
"careful don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!! cheating cautious. the phone is 100% used maybe fake! I've bought lot of Apple products! it always comes in foils. Battery cannot be charged on charging station, scratch and and....."
its to smaill can you change thiis item for me
"After 10 days of purchase entire Microphone unit stopped working. Contacted Amazon and they told to contact Apple support for further steps. Apple service is poor and they just provide some lame reasons everytime I contact them. Though the device is good, Apple service is not upto the mark which is also equally important."
Headphone was not also adapter not available for charging.
"Don't buy, waiting for my refund form 15 days"
It is best value for money handy phone. Very very convenient and sexy phone. Display may feel small for big screen lovers but overall it is best I phone with a good battery life which lasts whole day. The small size of phone is actually it's pro as it is very perfect for handling.

Pretty good I'm not ganna lie tho the battery life is also great the colour is just everything thank u
Except battery I am satisfied with this product. Apple should improve there upcoming phones with battery life. Overall I am not satisfied with the battery.
"Really loving this phone, always a apple fan. Upgraded from XR. Feels so handy and sleek. Getting rid of the typo due to screen size. If rumours are true this would be the last iPhone mini edition."

"I would suggest 12 Pro over 13 mini. Just a suggestion, I regret now and don't want you to fall for this trick of 13. Hard earned money should be well used. I don't see much difference between 12 Pro and 13 Mini with respect to Software and Hardware Upgrade, but we can see a high spike in cost of 13 Series."
"2. The size is a pleasure. It takes a little getting used to, especially for me coming from a 6.6‚Äù Realme X3. The good part is everything is within the reach of one handed operation - you can type single handedly too! Bad part is you‚Äôll probably miss the extra screen space in apps which are all optimised for big screens nowadays."
"Writing from 'iPhone xs max' I dint see a REAL WORLD improvement to upgrade from my phone till date. Its all about the extra camera and the camera placement. I am still in a Three year old phone which works smooth as butter, which no android does."

Wait few months and get it in half of price..
No major change and price is too high.
Iphone my first iphone in my life everything is ok but it
"Bekar, sasta phone, bad camera, not android phone, want 7 cameras, want battery with 1 year capacity , not satisfied at all"
It‚Äôs not a good phone. Buy iPhone 13 pro max. Better phones are still available in the market like androids
Helpful
Same as previous model iPhone 12 with smaller notch. Don't understand why price is high .
"Like iphone 11,12 now 13. All same look and minor differences. Why Apple fellows release phone with no new features"
"There are a bunch of reviews on the product already. Just sharing my 1st day experience so far, I loved it. This is a major upgrade for me, I jumped from iPhone 7 to 13mini after 4 years. Always wanted to smaller iPhone and looks like so far 13mini is by far the best predecessor of iPhone 7( for me interns of size vs performance ratio). Fantastic Camera, better battery life, and incredibly light phone. All the faults from iPhone 12mini are addressed in this phone. This will be a model which I can hold for at-least next three years in my opinion."
Initially I was sceptical about going for Iphone 13 mini as there were lot of bad reviews about the battery life of 12 mini. But this phone is a beast in terms of battery life and performance.I was fed up and bored using same big screen phones for years. But iphone 13 mini is perfect for my liking..Its a complete package.
"Simplistic design, good battery life, powerful hardware, excellent camera."
Phone
It provides amazing in hand experience with performance like a beast along with the best camera ever in iPhone and very good battery backup for a day my usage.
Best mobile phone
Big change upgrading from oneplus 6. The phone has excellent screen resolution. Battery life is excellent so far and for those who prefer a compact phone with one of the best camera outputs this is it.
The phone dimensions make is easy to use with one hand and fit in the pocket. The battery life is also good and with all the latest updates to iOS this makes it a real value for money phone.
An extraordinary phone at ordinary price.
Excellent amalgamation of software and hardware in iPhone 13.
"It's nice phone with classic look , premium finishing ( starlight ). Battery life is good comepared to predessor cinematic mode and night shots r really nice it's a best device which short movie makers can look forward . It's perfect size for mini lovers"

"Awesome phone. I didn‚Äôt expect the camera, sound and battery life this great."
Battery
The power this phone packs in such a convenient size and at this price is a revolution of its own. No battery issues the 12 mini had either. Absolutely loving it!
Very good battery backup‚Ä¶. Comparison with previous iPhone versions‚Ä¶
"Best User Experience,I am very happy"
This is the best smartphone I have ever used. It's just perfect for me.
"Go for it, no second thoughts"
Must buy if you are looking for smaller phone.
1. Memory
Loving it!!
I am in love with apple phones and ordered this model with mixed feelings reading about the reviews‚Ä¶ but i must say.. if u are looking for a smaller.. easy to handle phone.. then this is perfect choice‚Ä¶ not everyone likes big and bulky sets and this is phone not for people who like bigger screens‚Ä¶
Boring routine asual as expected very much disappointed üòû its same as 12 no changes at all not worth the hype
Good
"Love the product, even if it‚Äôs expensive. Use it and you‚Äôll never regret buying it. Initial difficulty of switching from Android to iOS is now gone. My data is safe and secure unlike my previous Samsung mobile. Apple needs to pay attention to battery capacity. Enjoying using it."
Why apple not bringing 64 or 128gb models of iphone 13 or mini?? Because prices wil be lower than 12 is main reason behind this. Apple making people fool and making money only MCü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
